        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>ECKERSALL is a California Limited Liability Company (LLC) founded in 2006. Our company founder, Scott Eckersall has been working with ESRI and other GIS technology since 1995. We’re fortunate to have a small but growing team of talented GIS professionals with a shared vision to provide outstanding and cost-effective GIS solutions to a growing list of happy clients. </p>
    
        <p>We specialize in Enterprise and Mobile GIS system design, database design, data conversion, software development, implementation, tuning, maintenance, training, and integration. Our focus is on government and utility clients. The team has a keen understanding of commercial and open source geospatial technologies. We offer our clients unbiased solutions that best meet their mission-critical needs without promoting any single approach or technology. We routinely connect GIS systems to many other databases and solutions and automate (and document) processes to keep it all running consistently and reliably. We team with our clients to simplify procedures and always strive to provide ample knowledge transfer so they can take it all over when we wrap up.</p>
        
        <p>We’ve traditionally teamed with larger consulting firms but we’re increasingly consulting with clients directly. This provides more direct communication and ultimately a better outcome. We have no extraneous sales, marketing, or executive staff which translates to low overhead. To ensure a quality product, we use no subcontractors or offshore staff. Each member of our team is a dedicated full time GIS practitioner here at our Chino office. We’re available remotely or on-site, subject to current COVID-19 mandates and our clients’ needs. We understand some clients prefer to have a consultant on-site, which we are willing and able to accommodate.</p>

                <p>Kimsan is a master's student from Institute of Technology of Cambodia and a non-residential intern from the East West Center base in Hawaii. Currently, he is doing research of drought and dam economic tradeoffs in Lower Mekong River Basin, supported by Wonders of the Mekong Project. While a coronavirus shaked the world in early 2020, Kimsan was selected to participate in a short exchange to States called Young South East Asia Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) Academic Fellowship. Unfortunately, the program has been becoming a hybrid method with virtual engagement with a hosted institute for 36 hours and 3 weeks in-person fellowship program after the situation allows. During the virtual and in-person program, he met many researchers in YSEALI’s program at East-West Center (EWC) bases in Hawaii. The program sent him to Innodays Organization to learn how to run an innovation challenge program. During that time, he has been co-contributed design the program on circular economy. The program was specific to EU and ASEAN students working together and finding solutions during 48hrs. YSEALI virtual institution also brought him to work with other fellows of the non-residential internship program at EWC. This program has improved his research career with effective presentation and scientific communication skills he has learned. In his academic jouney, he mastered his career on geospatial analysis (Argis and QGIS), hydrological modeling such as Soil Water Assessement Tool (SWAT), drought analysis such precipitation standardized index, streamflow drought Index(SDI), and other visualization’s program such as python, R-stadio and Matlab.</p>
