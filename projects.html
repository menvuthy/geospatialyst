        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>ECKERSALL is a California Limited Liability Company (LLC) founded in 2006. Our company founder, Scott Eckersall has been working with ESRI and other GIS technology since 1995. We’re fortunate to have a small but growing team of talented GIS professionals with a shared vision to provide outstanding and cost-effective GIS solutions to a growing list of happy clients. </p>
    
        <p>We specialize in Enterprise and Mobile GIS system design, database design, data conversion, software development, implementation, tuning, maintenance, training, and integration. Our focus is on government and utility clients. The team has a keen understanding of commercial and open source geospatial technologies. We offer our clients unbiased solutions that best meet their mission-critical needs without promoting any single approach or technology. We routinely connect GIS systems to many other databases and solutions and automate (and document) processes to keep it all running consistently and reliably. We team with our clients to simplify procedures and always strive to provide ample knowledge transfer so they can take it all over when we wrap up.</p>
        
        <p>We’ve traditionally teamed with larger consulting firms but we’re increasingly consulting with clients directly. This provides more direct communication and ultimately a better outcome. We have no extraneous sales, marketing, or executive staff which translates to low overhead. To ensure a quality product, we use no subcontractors or offshore staff. Each member of our team is a dedicated full time GIS practitioner here at our Chino office. We’re available remotely or on-site, subject to current COVID-19 mandates and our clients’ needs. We understand some clients prefer to have a consultant on-site, which we are willing and able to accommodate.</p>
